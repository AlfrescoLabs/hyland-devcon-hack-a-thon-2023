# Hyland DevCon Hack-a-thon 2023

Hyland DevCon 2023 is the international technical event specially tailored for developers using or evaluating Hylandâ€™s Alfresco and Nuxeo platforms.

During the first day of the event, an in person Hack-a-thon will be running in the venue. This project includes some instructions and a list of project ideas. It's not required to register your idea previously to participate the Hack-a-thon, but this list may help developers searching a project to join.

## Instructions

**For people with a project idea**

For each project, you should consider addressing the following:

* The idea owner(s)
* A brief description
* Any prep work for the project, such as developer tools or skills participants should understand

We encourage you to keep your project idea short and provide any additional details in separate document or blog post within the Collaborate space. This may also allow you to coordinate with potential team members via the comments there without being mixed in with any discussions on this page.

**For people looking to join a project**

Please feel free to add your name to any project(s) you are interested in participating. Don't hesitate to add your name to multiple projects if you are considering multiple at this point. We encourage you to use this platform to contact the owner of an idea to discuss any details you are unsure about or even improve upon the idea.

Apart from any plans you make with the owner of an idea, you are not bound to actually participate in the project you indicated here. When you join the hack-a-thon on the day of the event you can check with other project teams and join a different project, if that turns out to be a better fit for you.

**For everyone**

The Hyland DevCon Hack-a-thon is as much a social event as it is a coding one. This means a lot of the attendees for this event often use it to exchange ideas and discuss other matters in the general Alfresco and Nuxeo context.

After the event has come to an end, we encourage everyone that worked on a specific project idea to update the listing on this page with an overview of the project team and a link / reference to the results of the project (e.g. a GitHub repository, document or blog post in this space).

### Content Services

**Alfresco Search Services features for OOTBee Support Tools**

Idea owner: Angel Borroy

Description: Alfresco Search Services includes a set of *trackers* to index different elements from Alfresco Repository:

* Document Metadata is indexed by *MetadataTracker*
* Document Content is indexed by *ContentTracker*
* Document Path is indexed by *CascadeTracker*
* Document Permission is indexed by *AclTracker*

Since Alfresco out-of-the-box metrics don't provide enough detail on the progress of each *tracker*, this project aims to add a new option to [OOTBee Support Tools](https://github.com/OrderOfTheBee/ootbee-support-tools) to get and display the estimated progress of each *tracker*. Additional operations on SOLR Index may be also added.

Prep work: 

* [How many PATHS remain to be indexed?](https://hub.alfresco.com/t5/alfresco-content-services-blog/how-many-paths-remain-to-be-indexed/ba-p/314158)
* [Removing latest transactions from Alfresco Search Services](https://hub.alfresco.com/t5/alfresco-content-services-blog/removing-latest-transactions-from-alfresco-search-services/ba-p/312909)
* [How many CONTENT remains to be indexed?](https://hub.alfresco.com/t5/alfresco-content-services-blog/how-many-content-remains-to-be-indexed/ba-p/312459)
* [How to track the progress of the indexing process in Alfresco SOLR](https://hub.alfresco.com/t5/alfresco-content-services-blog/how-to-track-the-progress-of-the-indexing-process-in-alfresco/ba-p/301444)
